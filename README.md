### What I learned

In this challenge i tried to implement css grids here and there. I learned new things about grids and there usage. Moreover i learned how to use two images for a project when you want to have two different images for two screens.

This is the  HTMLcode to add two images on two diferent screen sizes.

```html
<picture>
      <source srcset="img/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="image" media="(min-width:600px)">
       <img src="img/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="image" width="600" height="900">
</picture>
```

### Continued development

I will continue to develop my skills in HTML and CSS some more before going into java script.I still cant do a project without help,But still i have improved so much. Gonna need to do some more challenges
